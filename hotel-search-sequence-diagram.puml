' ==============================

actor Client

participant "Backend" as BACKEND
participant "Database" as DB
participant "Cache" as CACHE
participant "Amadeus API" as AMADEUS

== Hotel Search Request ==

Client -> BACKEND: Search Hotels\n(destination, dates, guests, filters)

BACKEND -> BACKEND: Validate Request

BACKEND -> DB: Query hotels table\n(location, attributes, filters)
DB --> BACKEND: Hotel list (IDs + metadata)

BACKEND -> BACKEND: Rank & paginate hotels
note right of BACKEND
Ranking is computed once per search request
using deterministic signals (rating, popularity, distance).
The ordered hotel IDs are frozen into a search snapshot (searchId).
Pagination returns only the visible subset (e.g. top 20),
preventing duplicates across subsequent pages.
end note

BACKEND -> CACHE: Get cached offers\n(batch lookup)
CACHE --> BACKEND: Cache hits + misses

alt Cache miss exists
    BACKEND -> BACKEND: Check rate limits & budget
    BACKEND -> BACKEND: Start best-effort price fetch (time-boxed)
    BACKEND -> AMADEUS: Fetch hotel offers (async)\n[GET /v3/shopping/hotel-offers]
    note right of BACKEND
    Amadeus call is best-effort and time-boxed (e.g. 200–300 ms).
    Search response must not fail if pricing is unavailable.
    end note
    AMADEUS --> BACKEND: Hotel offers (if returned within timeout)
    BACKEND -> CACHE: Store offers
end


BACKEND -> BACKEND: Merge static + pricing
BACKEND -> BACKEND: Apply price filters & sorting

BACKEND --> Client: Search response\n(partial or full)

== Background Price Refresh ==

opt Async refresh
    BACKEND -> BACKEND: Determine missing / stale offers
    BACKEND -> AMADEUS: Refresh missing offers\n[GET /v3/shopping/hotel-offers]
    note right of BACKEND
    Async, throttled, batched refresh.
    Failures do not affect user requests.
    end note
    AMADEUS --> BACKEND: Updated offers
    BACKEND -> CACHE: Update cache
end

== Hotel Details / Repricing ==

Client -> BACKEND: View Hotel Details\n(hotelId, dates)

BACKEND -> CACHE: Get cached offer
CACHE --> BACKEND: Cached offer

alt Offer missing or stale
    BACKEND -> BACKEND: Start time-boxed repricing
    BACKEND -> AMADEUS: Fetch latest offer (time-boxed)\n[GET /v3/shopping/hotel-offers/{offerId}]
    note right of BACKEND
    Repricing is time-boxed and best-effort.
    If pricing fails, return explicit pricing error
    instead of stale or guessed price.
    end note
    AMADEUS --> BACKEND: Latest price (if available)
    BACKEND -> CACHE: Update offer
end

BACKEND --> Client: Hotel details + confirmed price
